## Design Choices

My core *Design Choices*: ***Conference Central*** is responsible for maintaining **Conferences**, **Profile**, **Sessions** and **Speakers**. **Sessions** belong to **Conferences** while **Speakers** are parallel entity that can  be assigned to any **Sessions** across **Conferences**. In addition a registed user to a conference can *add or deleted* **Sessions** to his or her wishlist.


### Task 1:

In **Task 1**, the objectives were to implement a **Session** entity along with various endpoints methods.

A **Session** can have speakers, a starting time, a date of occurrence, and a duration alongn with highlights. I have chosen to implement a **Session** that belongs to a **Conference**, and can only be altered by its creator.

A registered user with profile can create a new **Session** and must assign each **Session** to a parent **Conference**. The creation of a **Session** also requires the inclusion of a *Speaker* (speaker name), which is also an entity. However, if the *speaker name* as inserted does not exist, a new **Speaker** object will be added along with the current **Session** key, otherwise the **Speaker** entity is updated with the **Session** key appended to the list of *session keys*.

A **Speaker** is an entity with a fullname, and Session keys. The keys are not mandatory to create a speaker, and a speaker may exist outside of any conference parameters. This design decision will allow the **Speaker** entity to be part of any **Session**.
Potential some restrictions should be provided to prevent a speaker to be part of multiple sessions at the same time.


> See ***[Implementations for Task 1]***(task1addsessionstoaconference) for further details on the implemenations.



### Task 2:

Each ***Session*** object comes with a unique *key* property. This property serves many additional roles. One of the roles is to allow a registered user to add sessions to his or her wishlist.

I have decided to implement the following key methods endpoints.

* **addSessionToWishlist(SessionKey)** - ***As required***, to allow the selection of a session to user whishlist
* **getSessionsInWishlist()** - ***As required***, to show the list of sessions in the whishlist.
* **getAllSessionsInWishlist()** - this method retrieves all sessions across all conferences from a user wishlist
* **deleteSessionFromWishlist()** - this method was deemed necessary as it makes sense. A user should be able to modify the list.

>Note: The sessions are listed as part of SessionForm class, which allows the presentation of all information pertainining to the session.


### Task 3:

This task had three core objectives.

First, I have made some few modifications to index.yaml, see ***[Implementations for Task 3]***(task3_worksonindexesandqueries) for more details. All my indeces were verified with the Admin Console.

Second, I have thought of quite a few interesting queries. Below are the list of new queries implemented. I have further described two of them in ***[Implementations for Task 3]***(task3_worksonindexesandqueries).
     -  getAllSessionsInWishlist	             
     -  getAllSpeakers	                     
     -  getConferenceSessions	                 
     -  getConferenceSessionsByDate	         
     -  getConferenceSessionsByLocation	     
     -  getConferenceSessionsByLocationType	 
     -  getConferenceSessionsByLocationTypeDate
     -  getConferenceSessionsBySpeakerRole	 
     -  getConferenceSessionsByType	         
     -  getFeaturedSpeaker	                 
     -  getSessionsBySpeaker	                 
     -  getSessionsInWishlist	                 
     -  querySpeakers    
     -  getAllSessionsForNonWorksopsBefore7PM


Lastly, I have solved the following query problem: *Provided multiple sessions of different types and start time, I should be able to retrieve non-worksop sessions that start prior to 7 PM*.

At first, I thought this query was straightfoward, but soon there diffulties stemming mostly from design.
- Date and Time objects are created with default value of None
- Restrictions on multiple queries with inequality filter

Given these restrictions, and perhaps more. I was able devise a solution that only queries for startTime values being not `None`, then I would restrict the results by excluding all *Session Types* for ***Workshop***.

As described earlier **startTime** is a property of kind ***TimeProperty*** and **typeOfSession** in enumeration string value stemming from the class SessionType. 


### Task 4:

My solutions for this task was to introduce a *Memcache* and then register the associated task for storing the latest speaker that has been added and already having more than one sessions. The result for ***getFeaturedSpeaker()*** is transfered to **SpeakerForm()** class for display.See ***[Implementations for Task 4]***(task4_addatask).




## Implemented Tasks

### Task 1: Add Sessions to a Conference

#### Endpoints implemented:

1. getConferenceSessions(websafeConferenceKey)
    - Given a conference, return all sessions
1. getConferenceSessionsByType(websafeConferenceKey,typeOfSession)â€‹
    - Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type (eg lecture, keynote, workshop)
1. getSessionsBySpeaker(speaker)
    - Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker, across all conferences
1. createSession(SessionForm,websafeConferenceKey)
    - Create a session, open only to the organizer of the conference


#### Reasoning behind Sessions and Speaker implementations:

Sessions was implemented with the following attributes: 
##### sessionName, highlights, webSafeKey, typeOfSession, speaker, role, location, date, startTime, duration 

- ***webSafeKey*** corresponds to the the Conference (ancestor) to which the session belongs
- ***sessionName*** the actual name of the session as required for creation.
- ***speaker*** is the actual speaker name as required for creation. A new **Speaker** object is created if not found.
- ***highlights*** optional field for description and or highlights related to session
- ***location*** location for the session within the conference.
- ***date*** the actual date for the session formatted as *YYYY-MM-DD*
- ***startTime*** the actual time when the session would begin formatted as *HH24:MI*.
- ***duration*** represents the length of time a session should last in minutes. By default a session should last 50 minutes.
- ***role*** is an enumeration object describing the role of the speaker for the session. The default value is ***Speaker***.
    These are the complete options:
    * NOT_SPECIFIED
    * Speaker
    * Host
    * Keynote
    * Presenter
- ***typeOfSession*** represents the enumeration field for the type of session. The Default value is ***TBD***.
    These are the complete options:
    * TBD
    * UNKNOWN
    * Workshop
    * Case_Study
    * Tutorial
    * Talk
    * Keynote
    * Demonstration
    * Panel
    * Special
    * Forum


Similarly the **Speaker** is implemented as an entity: name, sessionKeys.
Where:

- ***name*** is the speaker name
- ***sessionKeys*** are keys of the actual sessions that the speaker would present.
 
 
> Note:
A session belongs to a conference as its parent ancestor, each session may have a speaker. However the speaker entity exists outside of a conference.
The method endpoint `getAllSpeakers` will return all available speakers outside of conferences.



### Task 2: Add Sessions to User Wishlist

A user can add, retrieve and delete session to a wishlist of sessions to attend.

The following API methoods were defined to support Session Whishlist

1. ***addSessionToWishlist(SessionKey)***
    - adding the session to the user's list of sessions they are interested in attending.
1. ***deleteSessionFromWishlist(SessionKey)***
    - deletes the session from the user's list of sessions expected to attend.
1. ***getSessionsInWishlist()***
    - query for all the sessions in a conference that the user is interested in.



### Task 3: Works on indexes and queries

New indeces were added to `index.yaml` representing queries of more than one search items in addition to ancestor key.

These are some of the method endpoints to use complex queries:

- getConferenceSessionsByLocationByTypeByDate
- getConferenceSessionsByLocationByType


These are excerpts from indeces added to support complex queries:

    - kind: Session
      ancestor: yes
      properties:
      - name: location
      - name: typeOfSession
      
     - kind: Session
      ancestor: yes
      properties:
      - name: location
      - name: typeOfSession
      - name: date


Lastly:

The indeces were modified to provide a better return on the query:


    - kind: Session
      properties:
      - name: typeOfSession
      - name: startTime


Below are code excerpts:



        sessions = Session.query(ndb.AND(
            Session.startTime !=  None,
            Session.startTime < datetime.strptime('19:00'[:10], "%H:%M").time())
        ).fetch()

        return SessionForms(
            items=[(self._copySessionToForm(session)) for session in sessions if session.typeOfSession != 'Workshop']
        )



### Task 4: Add a Task

Whenever a new session is added to a conference, a new task is queued to check whether the speaker has more than one session in the conference. If so a new Memcache entry is created for 
feature the speaker and session names.
As such the following single Endpoint is defined:

1. ***getFeaturedSpeaker()***
    - returns the featured speaker, if any.
